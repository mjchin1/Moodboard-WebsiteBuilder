Moodboard is a full-stack application that uses form data submitted by users to instantly design a beautiful website. While I love experimenting with design, I understand that making design decisions can be a huge hassle for many people when creating a website. Moodboard takes these decisions off the user’s plate, organizing their information and images into a universally flattering format. While users can create a website without logging in, once they create an account, they gain the functionality to save and edit the websites they have created.
